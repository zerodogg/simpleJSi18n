simpleJSi18n is a simple gettext-like i18n library (and various utilities) for
javascript.

Currently it consists of two utilities and one basic i18n library, but it
might be extended to include additional variants of the i18n library.

Utilities:

jsxgettext		A "xgettext" wrapper for JavaScript files. Can be used to build
				PO-files with strings from JavaScript files (strings enclosed
				in either _() or gettext()).

				Usage: ./jsxgettext outfile.pot infile1.js infile2.js ..

jsmsgfmt        A "msgfmt"-like wrapper for JavaScript files. Can be used to build
				a single JavaScript file that contains the basic i18n library
				along with the strings for each language.

				The filenames of the file.po files are used as a language
				identifier.

				Usage: ./jsmsgfmt outfile.js infile1.po infile2.po ..

In short, jsxgettext builds a PO-file and jsmsgfmt builds a full JS file
that contains the JS library and the translations. Include this file in
your app and it will handle language detection etc. for you.
