simpleJSi18n is a simple gettext-like i18n library (and various utilities) for
javascript.

Currently it consists of three utilities and one basic i18n library, but it
might be extended to include additional variants of the i18n library.

Utilities:

jsxgettext		A "xgettext" wrapper for JavaScript files. Can be used to build
				PO-files with strings from JavaScript files (strings enclosed
				in either _() or gettext()).

				Usage: ./jsxgettext outfile.pot infile1.js infile2.js ..

po2json			Converts a gettext PO-file into a JSON datastructure that
				the JS library can use.

buildBundle		Builds a single javascript file that contains the basic i18n
				library, along with the strings for each language.

				Usage: ./buildBundle output.js infile.po.json infile2.po.json

				The filenames of the po.json files are used as a language
				identifier.

In short, jsxgettext builds a PO-file, po2json converts a PO-file to a JSON
structure and buildBundle converts several JSON files into a single usable
i18n library with all strings.
